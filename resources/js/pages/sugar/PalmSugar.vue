                    Palm sugar is a sweetener derived from any variety of palm
                    tree. Palm sugar is sometimes qualified by the type of palm,
                    as in coconut palm sugar. While sugars from different palms
                    may have slightly different compositions, all are processed
                    similarly and can be used interchangeably.
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                    Palm sugar is known in many names and many variants, depends
                    on its ingredient, production method, or the region. It is
                    known as gula jawa (Javanese sugar) in Indonesia.
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                    There is specific difference on palm sugar naming in
                    Indonesia; if it is made from coconut, it is called as gula
                    jawa or gula merah (red sugar), on the other hand gula aren
                    (aren sugar) refer to palm sugar that specifically made from
                    the sap of aren palm flowerbuds. Gula jawa has an earthy
                    aroma and deep sweetness with a darker colour closely
                    resembling molasses, while gula aren has paler colour.
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                    Palm sugar is considered a healthier alternative to other
                    sweeteners because its production involves minimal
                    processing with no added chemicals. Because it’s unrefined,
                    it also retains high levels of plant-based vitamins and
                    minerals that can benefit your health. Palm sugar also has a
                    low glycemic index compared to other sweeteners, which means
                    it’s less likely to cause your blood sugar to spike and
                    crash. While research is ongoing, some studies suggest that
                    palm sugar is a good alternative sweetener for people with
                    diabetes. You can buy palm sugars at most supermarkets, and
                    some places sell it in both solid sugar and honey-like
                    liquid forms.
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                    Palm sugar also contains manganese. This mineral aids in
                    bone health and may reduce your risk of osteoporosis. It has
                    also been studied for its potential in the reduction of some
                    risk factors of diabetes, like insulin resistance. Too much
                    sugar in your diet increases your risks for these conditions
                    and other chronic diseases, however. While palm sugar
                    contains a range of health-boosting nutrients, it should
                    only be consumed in moderation.

                    Potential Health Benefits of Palm Sugar Palm sugar is a
                    better source of vitamins and minerals than comparable
                    sweeteners. However, many people consume too much sugar,
                    which can cause health issues like heart disease, diabetes,
                    and obesity. When consumed in moderation as an alternative
                    to other sweeteners, palm sugar’s nutrients have
                    health-boosting benefits like:
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                    <b>Blood Sugar Regulation</b><br />

                    Palm sugar contains less glucose and a lower glycemic index
                    than table sugar or honey. This helps to stabilize blood
                    sugar levels better than other sweeteners so your energy
                    levels don’t spike and crash — and reduces strain on your
                    heart.<br /><br />

                    <b>Promotes Better Digestion</b><br />

                    Palm sugar contains a dietary fiber called inulin. Studies
                    show that this plant-based fiber can help control bacteria
                    in your gut, promotes good digestion, and improves your
                    body’s mineral absorption.<br /><br />

                    <b>Nervous System Function</b><br />

                    By weight, palm sugar has higher levels of potassium than
                    green vegetables and bananas. Potassium is necessary for
                    maintaining good nervous system activity, like muscle
                    contractions and a regular heartbeat. Consuming enough
                    potassium can also help manage high blood pressure.<br /><br />

                    <b>More Antioxidants than Other Sugars</b><br />

                    Research shows that palm sugar contains higher levels of
                    vitamins, minerals, and nutrients than other sugars. This
                    nutritional content includes phytonutrients. These
                    plant-based compounds have an antioxidant effect, which
                    prevents cell damage that can lead to chronic diseases.
